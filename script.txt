[Reporter]: Coach, tough season — a 10–9 record. What went wrong?

[Coach]: Look, we started strong in most games. Our first-half goal stats were solid — we outscored opponents by 23 in the first half. But the second half? We were outscored by 9 goals. That’s a 32-goal swing. That’s unacceptable.

[Reporter]: Was it offense or defense that let you down?

[Coach]: A bit of both. But honestly, our offense dried up late. We were outshot overall — 552 to 538 — and we didn’t maintain pressure in the fourth quarter. Our rotations were thin, and it showed.

[Reporter]: What’s the plan for next season?

[Coach]: We’re focusing on late-game stamina and deeper offensive options. We’ve got the talent — we just need consistency. Two more wins were right there for us. We're fixing that.
