# Tools Tried – Task 06: Deep Fake Interview

This file documents the tools I explored to convert my interview script into audio or video form.

---

## 🧰 Tools I Explored:

### 🎙️ ElevenLabs (https://www.elevenlabs.io/)
- ✅ Very realistic voices
- ✅ Free tier available (with limited generation time)
- ⚠️ Requires account signup
- ✅ Successfully generated natural-sounding voice from my script

---

### 🧰 Narakeet (https://www.narakeet.com/)
- ✅ Browser-based text-to-speech tool
- ✅ Offers download as MP3
- ❌ Some voices sound robotic unless adjusted
- ✅ Simple to use, no install needed

---

### 🧰 TTSMP3 (https://ttsmp3.com)
- ✅ Super fast
- ✅ Free without login for small text
- ❌ Robotic, no emotional tone
- ✅ Good backup option for quick testing

---

### ❌ Tools Considered But Not Used:

- **D-ID / HeyGen / Synthesia** – Video generation tools
  - ❌ All required a paid plan or had limited free credits
  - ✅ Good for future use if needed

---

## 💡 Reflections:

- Most tools work well for audio-based deep fakes
- ElevenLabs gave the best quality with the least effort
- Tools like HeyGen would be great for video, but were not used due to credit/paywall limits
